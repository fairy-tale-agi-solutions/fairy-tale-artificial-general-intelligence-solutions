**General Intelligence** (GI) is the intelligence of a system that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. - adapted from Wikipedia definition of AGI

**Intelligence** is a **metric** that measures **how efficient** an **agent** is at achieving **any possible goal** under **any context**.

Intelligence is a metric - let's say one dimensional for now. By convention the higher the value of the metric the more efficient the agent is at performing actions which would allow it to achieve any possible goal under any context.

Efficiency usually means achieving goals with minimal resource usage: space or time.

An agent is a bunch of particles or fields occupying a spatial slice of the universe that can make decisions (take actions).

A goal is any constraint/convergence on the possible futures.

A context means that the system could be put in any possible environment.

Environment would be everything outside of the system - the rest of the world.

^ How full reality determinism would interfere with this should be accounted for - whether it matters or not.
