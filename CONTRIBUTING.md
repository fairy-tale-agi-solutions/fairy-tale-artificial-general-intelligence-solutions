## How to contribute to the creation of Safe Artificial General Intelligence

* first - try to be as Safe a Biological General Intelligence as you can yourself :) since creating Safe AGI is easier the better we understand Safety ourselves and the better we are at doing Generally Intelligent stuff ourselves. So it is kind of meta but the more of a general intelligence you become yourself the more capable you will become at contributing to the creation of safe AGI
* help any group working on AGI to achieve better safety guarantees - one of the main thing most AGI groups working on AGI seem to be missing are the use of high level programming languages with good static type-safety guarantees (Agda, Idris, Coq, Haskell, Purescript, etc.) as the way to ensure safety
* join us in the [Human Level Artificial Intelligence](https://discord.gg/nnKFSTR) and discuss helpful Safe AGI stuff
* ask to join the [Fairy Tale GitHub organization](https://github.com/fairy-tale-agi-solutions/fairy-tale-artificial-general-intelligence-solutions#the-fairy-tale-team) and help with work on GitHub Issues
* publish (high level natural language | programming language | diagram | ...) of how you think Safe Artificial General Intelligences could be designed -> create a folder with your name under Ideas folder and add them there. Provide links to where there are more details about the system also if available.
* review and/or contribute to other ideas, code, diagrams, etc. in the repository
* star the GitHub repository if you think that what is in it is useful/good - that is minimal effort with maximum effects in helping us gain more traction
