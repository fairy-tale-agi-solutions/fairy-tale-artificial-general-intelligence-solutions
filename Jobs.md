# Human-Level AI Engineer / Researcher / Safety Specialist

We are hiring for 1 role for working on Human-Level AI related goals. The role title will probably be something along the lines of Human-Level AI Engineer / Researcher / Safety Specialist

The ideal skills to apply for the role are:

* passion about HLAI Safety demonstrated through previous work or knowledge gained
* programming skills: ideally Haskell or some similar FP language (PureScript, Idris, Agda, LEAN, F#, F*, Scala, Kotlin, Rust), also Prolog
* knowing how to program using a dependently typed programming language: Idris, Agda, Haskell, etc.
* knowledge of category theory - this helps with understanding more advanced Haskell abstractions
* automated theorem proving knowledge: Agda, LEAN, Coq, Isabelle, etc.
* knowledge of how to utilize pre-runtime checks to ensure safety (such as compile time error elimination)
* skilled in writing tests: unit, integration, property based testing, manual testing, etc.
* have an understanding of AGI/HLAI runtime containment levels
* for desired personality traits, see: https://github.com/fairy-tale-agi-solutions/fairy-tale-artificial-general-intelligence-solutions#our-core-values-are The most important traits are probably being willing to learn, proactive, not afraid to ask questions and be open minded.

What you will be doing: basically anything required for us to maximize the increase of probability of having a good future for humans and machines.

To be more concrete you will probably be spending lots of time writing free and open source software that would be useful towards that goal. We will be implementing a lot of free and open source software and using the donations from it etc. we will be funding hiring more developers. We will be using the money from donations to fund work on hiring more staff and working on more projects until we can afford to work on Safe Human-Level AI implementation directly. I am also currently working on securing other sources of funding for us.

If you wish to apply message me directly here with your resume and ideally present yourself in a few words as to why you think you would be a good fit for this role. You can also email me at: razvan.panda@gmail.com

The reason I am hiring is because I do not have enough time to progress fast enough, so hiring someone would about double the efficiency at which we are approaching the HLAI Safety goals.
