## Organization main goal

We are a worldwide community dedicated to ensuring a good future for sentient beings.

## Organization instrumental goals

Helping humanity create safe human-level artificial intelligence (artificial general intelligence) as soon as possible.

Working on free and open source software:

* software that will provide great gains in accelerating human progress towards safe HLAI (AGI)
* software which it targeted at accelerating the pace of science done by humanity
* software for increasing the efficiency of achieving goals / doing tasks

We are working on free and open source software because I think that would be the most efficient way of achieving our goals.

## Approach to safe human-level AI and good future for sentient beings

Approaching this from two directions:

* improve efficiency of humanity by helping reduce resource consumption, decreasing the time required to achieve goals and improving the rate at which science is done
* ensure creation of safe human-level AI through proper science-based methods

Both goals above will be mainly worked on through creation of free and open source software.

## Our core values are

* pursuit of truth using science for the betterment of mankind and other life forms
* excellence - we will do our best to create the best solutions
* focus - we will work on the most important problems humanity is facing
* perseverance - we will not give up on a path to the solution unless it makes sense to do so and then try a different approach to solving it
* anything being said needs to be backed up by evidence
* honesty
* trust
* respect
* fairness
* loyalty
* open mindedness
